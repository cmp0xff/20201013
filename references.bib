  abstract  = {The present note is suggested by a recent paper by Prof. Darwin,* and is intended to show how one of the most typically particle-like properties of matter can be derived from the wave mechanics. In the theory of radioactive disintegration, as presented by Gamow, the ∝-particle is represented by a spherical wave which slowly leaks out of the nucleus. On the other hand, the ∝-particle, once emerged, has particle-like properties, the most striking being the ray tracks that it forms in a Wilson cloud chamber. It is a little difficult to picture how it is that an outgoing spherical wave can produce a straight track ; we think intuitively that it should ionise atoms at random throughout space. We could consider that Gamow’s outgoing spherical wave should give the probability of disintegration, but that, when the particle is outside the nucleus, it should be represented by a wave packet moving in a definite direction, so as to produce a straight track. But it ought not to be necessary to do this. The wave mechanics unaided ought to be able to predict the possible results of any observation that we could make on a system, without invoking, until the moment at which the observation is made, the classical particle-like properties of the electrons or α-particles forming that system. If we consider the ∝-ray alone as the system under consideration, then the gas of the Wilson chamber must be considered as the means by which we observe the particle ; so in this case we must consider the ∝-ray as α-particle as soon as it is outside the nucleus, because that is the moment at which the observation is made. If, however, we consider the α-particle and the gas together as one system, then it is ionised atoms that we observe ; interpreting the wave function should give us simply the probability that such and such an atom is ionised. Until this final interpretation is made, no mention should be made of the ∝-ray being a particle at all. The difficulty that we have in picturing how it is that a spherical wave can produce a straight track arises from our tendency to picture the wave as existing in ordinary three dimensional space, whereas we are really dealing with wave functions in the multispace formed by the co-ordinates both of the α-particle and of every atom in the Wilson chamber.},

  abstract    = {Building on an insight due to Avramidi, we provide a system of transport equations for determining key fundamental bi-tensors, including derivatives of the world-function, \sigma(x,x'), the square root of the Van Vleck determinant, \Delta^{1/2}(x,x'), and the tail-term, V(x,x'), appearing in the Hadamard form of the Green function. These bi-tensors are central to a broad range of problems from radiation reaction to quantum field theory in curved spacetime and quantum gravity. Their transport equations may be used either in a semi-recursive approach to determining their covariant Taylor series expansions, or as the basis of numerical calculations. To illustrate the power of the semi-recursive approach, we present an implementation in \textsl{Mathematica} which computes very high order covariant series expansions of these objects. Using this code, a moderate laptop can, for example, calculate the coincidence limit a_7(x,x) and V(x,x') to order (\sigma^a)^{20} in a matter of minutes. Results may be output in either a compact notation or in xTensor form. In a second application of the approach, we present a scheme for numerically integrating the transport equations as a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. As an example application of the scheme, we integrate along null geodesics to solve for V(x,x') in Nariai and Schwarzschild spacetimes.},

The paper is, nonetheless, self-contained in such a way that all the main results on the inverse integrating factor are stated and a complete overview of the subject is given. Each section contains a different issue to which the inverse integrating factor plays a role: the integrability problem, relation with Lie symmetries, the center problem, vanishing set of an inverse integrating factor, bifurcation of limit cycles from either a period annulus or from a monodromic $\omega$-limit set and some generalizations.},

On the other hand, the relativity theory has led to the study of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, which turns out to be the most general framework for the study of minimal submanifolds. However, most of the recent books on the subject still present the theory only in the Riemannian case.

For the first time, this book provides a self-contained and accessible introduction to the subject in the general setting of pseudo-Riemannian geometry, only assuming from the reader some basic knowledge about manifold theory. Several classical results, such as the Weierstrass representation formula for minimal surfaces, and the minimizing properties of complex submanifolds, are presented in full generality without sacrificing the clarity of exposition. Finally, a number of very recent results on the subject, including the classification of equivariant minimal hypersurfaces in pseudo-Riemannian space forms and the characterization of minimal Lagrangian surfaces in some pseudo-Kähler manifolds are given.},

In particular, they are indispensable in theoretical studies of condensed matter physics, gravity, and particle physics. Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition introduces the ideas and techniques of differential geometry and topology at a level suitable for postgraduate students and researchers in these fields.

The second edition of this popular and established text incorporates a number of changes designed to meet the needs of the reader and reflect the development of the subject. The book features a considerably expanded first chapter, reviewing aspects of path integral quantization and gauge theories. Chapter 2 introduces the mathematical concepts of maps, vector spaces, and topology. The following chapters focus on more elaborate concepts in geometry and topology and discuss the application of these concepts to liquid crystals, superfluid helium, general relativity, and bosonic string theory. Later chapters unify geometry and topology, exploring fiber bundles, characteristic classes, and index theorems. New to this second edition is the proof of the index theorem in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The final two chapters are devoted to the most fascinating applications of geometry and topology in contemporary physics, namely the study of anomalies in gauge field theories and the analysis of Polakov's bosonic string theory from the geometrical point of view.

Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition is an ideal introduction to differential geometry and topology for postgraduate students and researchers in theoretical and mathematical physics. },

In this rather technical article we shall generalize the Raychaudhuri equation in several ways. First an improved version of the standard timelike Raychaudhuri equation is developed, where several key terms are lumped together as a divergence. This already has a number of interesting applications, both within the ADM formalism and elsewhere. Second, a spacelike version of the Raychaudhuri equation is briefly discussed. Third, a version of the Raychaudhuri equation is developed that does not depend on the use of normalized congruences. This leads to useful formulae for the "diagonal" part of the Ricci tensor. Fourth, a "two vector" version of the Raychaudhuri equation is developed that uses two congruences to effectively extract "off diagonal" information concerning the Ricci tensor.},

  abstract  = {This book gives a comprehensive overview of all relevant elements in topography and their practical application. It elaborates on the classical representation of terrain on maps such as cartographic projections, together with their classification, scale, and geographical elements. It is richly illustrated with photographs, maps and figures, in which the theoretical explanations are clarified.

Readers will become acquainted with the physical characteristics of the ground, i.e. tectonic and erosive shapes, the importance and classification of terrain, genetic (fluvial, abrasive, glacial, karst) and topographic types such as higher (mountains, hills, peaks) and lower terrain (valleys, fields). In addition, the book discusses cartometry and coordinate systems, orientation in space (geographic, topographic, tactical) including by means of maps, instruments and the night sky and elaborates new techniques and technologies such as aerial photogrammetric imagery, global navigation satellite systems and LiDAR.

The book also includes methods for the practical execution of concrete measurement operations, such as determining position and movement on land with maps, compass and azimuth which makes it especially useful for practitioners and professionals, e.g., for landscape planning, military exercises, mountaineering, nature walks etc. As such it offers a valuable guide not only for undergraduate students but also for researchers in the fields of geography, geosciences, geodesy, ecology, forestry and related areas looking for an overview on topography. Uniquely, the book also features an extensive glossary of topographical terms.},

In this book, Bewersdorff follows the historical development of the theory, emphasizing concrete examples along the way. As a result, many mathematical abstractions are now seen as the natural consequence of particular investigations.

Few prerequisites are needed beyond general college mathematics, since the necessary ideas and properties of groups and fields are provided as needed. Results in Galois theory are formulated first in a concrete, elementary way, then in the modern form. Each chapter begins with a simple question that gives the reader an idea of the nature and difficulty of what lies ahead. The applications of the theory to geometric constructions, including the ancient problems of squaring the circle, duplicating the cube, and trisecting an angle, and the construction of regular n-gons are also presented.

This book is suitable for undergraduates and beginning graduate students.},

Der rote Faden ist eines der fundamentalen Probleme der Algebra: Bereits vor 4000 Jahren wurden quadratische Gleichungen gelöst. Im 16. Jahrhundert fand man allgemeine Lösungsformeln für Gleichungen dritten und vierten Grades, aber entsprechende Bemühungen für Gleichungen fünften Grades schlugen fehl. Dies führte schließlich zur Begründung der sogenannten Galois-Theorie: Mit ihrer Hilfe kann festgestellt werden, ob eine Gleichung mittels geschachtelter Wurzelausdrücke lösbar ist. Das Buch eignet sich als Orientierungshilfe und liefert eine gute Motivation für die moderne Galois-Theorie. Es richtet sich insbesondere an Studierende, Gymnasiallehrer(innen)  und Lehrende an Hochschulen.

Für die Neuauflage wurden diverse Faksimiles ergänzt. Dazu begleitend wurde das erste Kapitel erheblich erweitert, so dass die maßgeblichen kulturhistorischen Kontexte der Epochen bis Cardano deutlicher werden. Im Kapitel über Artins Beweis des Hauptsatzes der Galois-Theorie wurden Anmerkungen zum historischen Hintergrund hinzugefügt.},

The complete sets of Wigner functions necessary to expand all phase-space functions include off-diagonal Wigner functions, which may appear technically involved. Nevertheless, it is shown here that suitable generating functions of these complete sets can often be constructed, which are relatively simple, and lead to compact evaluations of matrix elements. New features of such generating functions are detailed and explored for integer-indexed sets, such as for the harmonic oscillator, as well as continuously indexed ones, such as for the linear potential and the Liouville potential. The utility of such generating functions is illustrated in the computation of star functions, spectra, and perturbation theory in phase space.},

The different solutions within the class arise from the topologically inequivalent choices of the integration contours in the transformation from the Ashtekarrepresentation to the metric representation. We show how the saddle-points of the reduced Chern-Simons functional generate a complete basis of such integration contours and the associated solutions. Among the solutions we identify two, which, semi-classically, satisfy the boundary conditions proposed by Vilenkin and by Hartle and Hawking, respectively. In the limit of vanishing cosmological constant our solutions reduce to a class found earlier in special fermion sectors ofsupersymmetric Bianchi type IX models.},

In the quantum case of quintessence field with potential unbounded from below and phantom field, the energy density operators are not essentially self-adjoint and self-adjoint extensions contain ambiguities. Therefore the same classical actions correspond to a family of distinct quantum models. For the phantom field the energy spectrum happens to be discrete. The probability conservation and appropriate classical limit can be achieved with a certain restriction of the functional class. The appropriately localized wave packets are studied numerically using the Schrodinger's norm and a conserved Mostafazadeh's norm introduced from techniques of pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. These norms give a similar packet evolution that is confronted with analytical classical solutions.},

  abstract     = {We study some consequences of noncommutativity to homogeneous cosmologies by introducing a deformation of the commutation relation between the minisuperspace variables. The investigation is carried out for the Kantowski-Sachs model by means of a comparative study of the universe evolution in four different scenarios: the classical commutative, classical noncommutative, quantum commutative, and quantum noncommutative. The comparison is rendered transparent by the use of the Bohmian formalism of quantum trajectories. As a result of our analysis, we found that noncommutativity can modify significantly the universe evolution, but cannot alter its singular behavior in the classical context. Quantum effects, on the other hand, can originate non-singular periodic universes in both commutative and noncommutative cases. The quantum noncommutative model is shown to present interesting properties, as the capability to give rise to non-trivial dynamics in situations where its commutative counterpart is necessarily static.},

As is well known, these models are connected to minimally coupled models through the combination of a conformal transformation and a transformation of the scalar field. The explicit forms of the self-interaction potentials for six exactly solvable models are presented here. We obtain the general solution for one of the integrable models, namely, the induced gravity model with a power-law potential for the self-interaction of the scalar field. We argue that although being mathematically in a one-to-one correspondence with the solutions in the minimally coupled models, the solutions in the corresponding non-minimally coupled models are physically different. This is because the cosmological evolutions seen by an internal observer connected with the cosmic time can be quite different. The study of a few induced gravity models with particular potentials gives us an explicit example of such a difference.},

  abstract     = {Selection of physically meaningful solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the wavefunction in quantum cosmology, can be attained by a reduction of the theory to the sector of true physical degrees of freedom and their canonical quantization. The resulting physical wavefunction unitarily evolving in the time variable introduced within this reduction can then be raised to the level of the cosmological wavefunction in superspace of 3-metrics. We apply this technique in several simple minisuperspace models and discuss both at classical and quantum level physical reduction in {\em extrinsic} time -- the time variable determined in terms of extrinsic curvature. Only this extrinsic time gauge can be consistently used in vicinity of turning points and bounces where the scale factor reaches extremum. Since the 3-metric scale factor is canonically dual to extrinsic time variable, the transition from the physical wavefunction to the wavefunction in superspace represents a kind of the generalized Fourier transform. This transformation selects square integrable solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, which guarantee Hermiticity of canonical operators of the Dirac quantization scheme. Semiclassically this means that wavefunctions are represented by oscillating waves in classically allowed domains of superspace and exponentially fall off in classically forbidden (underbarrier) regions. This is explicitly demonstrated in flat FRW model with a scalar field having a constant negative potential and for the case of phantom scalar field with a positive potential. The FRW model of a scalar field with a vanishing potential does not lead to selection rules for solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, but this does not violate Hermiticity properties, because all these solutions are anyway of plane wave type and describe cosmological dynamics without turning points and bounces.},

The effort to explain this current state has focused attention on cosmological models in which the dominant component of the cosmic energy density has negative pressure, with an equation of state $w \ge -1$. Remarking that most observations are consistent with models right up to the $w=-1$ or cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) limit, it is natural to ask what lies on the other side, at $w<-1$. In this regard, we construct a toy model of a ``phantom'' energy component which possesses an equation of state $w<-1$. Such a component is found to be compatible with most classical tests of cosmology based on current data, including the recent type 1a SNe data as well as the cosmic microwave background anisotropy and mass power spectrum. If the future observations continue to allow $w<-1$, then barring unanticipated systematic effects, the dominant component of the cosmic energy density may be stranger than anything expected.},

Three models are discussed explicitly: a toy model, a model with an exponential phantom potential, and a model with phantom field accompanied by a negative cosmological constant. In all these cases we calculate the classical trajectories in configuration space and give solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology. In the cases of the toy model and the model with exponential potential we are able to solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation exactly. For comparison, we also give the corresponding solutions for an ordinary scalar field. We discuss in particular the behaviour of wave packets in minisuperspace. For the phantom field these packets disperse in the region that corresponds to the Big Rip singularity. This thus constitutes a genuine quantum region at large scales, described by a regular solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. For the ordinary scalar field, the Big-Bang singularity is avoided. Some remarks on the arrow of time in phantom models as well as on the relation of phantom models to loop quantum cosmology are given.},

  Abstract                 = {This book is a systematic study of the classical and quantum theories of gauge systems. It starts with Dirac's analysis showing that gauge theories are constrained Hamiltonian systems. The classical foundations of BRST theory are then laid out with a review of the necessary concepts from homological algebra. Reducible gauge systems are discussed, and the relationship between BRST cohomology and gauge invariance is carefully explained. The authors then proceed to the canonical quantization of gauge systems, first without ghosts (reduced phase space quantization, Dirac method) and second in the BRST context (quantum BRST cohomology). The path integral is discussed next. The analysis covers indefinite metric systems, operator insertions, and Ward identities. The antifield formalism is also studied and its equivalence with canonical methods is derived. The examples of electromagnetism and abelian 2-form gauge fields are treated in detail.

The book gives a general and unified treatment of the subject in a self-contained manner. Exercises are provided at the end of each chapter, and pedagogical examples are covered in the text.},

This is achieved by a decomposition of four-dimenensional spacetime into a foliation of spacelike hypersurfaces. Special attention is devoted to open spaces and the structure of the configuration space. The canonical formalism is presented for metric, connection, and loop variables.},

  abstract  = {This book is concerned with the attempts to unify Einstein's theory of general relativity and quantum theory into a theory of quantum gravity. It presents, for the first time, most of the approaches in a single textbook. Among them are canonical quantum gravity (including loop quantum gravity), covariant quantum gravity, and string theory. The book also discusses the relevance of these theories for cosmology and the physics of black holes. The first chapter gives a general introduction to the problem of quantizing the gravitational field. The second chapter then presents the main covariant approaches - perturbation theory and Feynman diagrammes, path integrals, and supergravity. The third chapter discusses the important concept of reparametrization invariance in the framework of simple systems: particle models, bosonic string, and parametrized field theory. This concept plays a crucial role in the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity, which is the topic of Chapter 4. Chapter 5 presents the canonical quantization in the metric variables, leading to the central Wheeler-DeWitt equation, while the sixth chapter presents loop quantum gravity. The next two chapters 7 and 8 then discuss the major applications - quantization of black holes and quantum cosmology. Chapter 9 gives an introduction to string theory by focusing on its quantum gravitational aspects. Chapter 10 contains a discussion of interpretational issues: the relevance of quantum gravity for the foundations of quantum theory and the arrow of time. It also contains a brief review of quantum-gravity phenomenology. The emphasis throughout is on conceptual and formal clarity. Wherever possible, connections between the various approaches are examined.},

  Abstract                 = {We show that in a sense of distributions \[\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0+} {1\over \pi^2} \tau\sinh\pi\tau \int_{\varepsilon}^{\infty} K_{i\tau}(y)K_{ix}(y){dy\over y} =\delta(\tau-x),\] where \(\delta\) is the Dirac distribution, \(\tau\), \(x\in\mathbb{R}\) and \(K_{\nu}(x)\) is the modified Bessel function. The convergence is in \(\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R})\) for any even \(\varphi(x)\in\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R})\) being a restriction to \(\mathbb{R}\) of a function \(\varphi(z)\) analytic in a horizontal open strip \(G_a=\{z\in\mathbb{C}\colon\,|\text{Im}\,z|\lt a, \ a\gt 0\}\) and continuous in the strip closure. Moreover, it satisfies the condition \(\varphi(z)=O\bigl(|z|^{-\text{Im}\,z-\alpha}e^{-\pi|\text{Re}\,z|/2}\bigr)\), \(|\text{Re}\,z|\to\infty\), \(\alpha\gt 1\) uniformly in \(\overline{G_a}\). The result is applied to prove the representation theorem for the inverse Kontorovich-Lebedev transformation on distributions.},

These potentials are extremely useful in deducing the gross features of the evolution of the metric variables.},

  abstract    = {The numerical prediction, theoretical analysis, and experimental verification of the phenomenon of wave packet revivals in quantum systems has flourished over the last decade and a half. Quantum revivals are characterized by initially localized quantum states which have a short-term, quasi-classical time evolution, which then can spread significantly over several orbits, only to reform later in the form of a quantum revival in which the spreading reverses itself, the wave packet relocalizes, and the semi-classical periodicity is once again evident. Relocalization of the initial wave packet into a number of smaller copies of the initial packet (`minipackets' or `clones') is also possible, giving rise to fractional revivals. Systems exhibiting such behavior are a fundamental realization of time-dependent interference phenomena for bound states with quantized energies in quantum mechanics and are therefore of wide interest in the physics and chemistry communities. We review the theoretical machinery of quantum wave packet construction leading to the existence of revivals and fractional revivals, in systems with one (or more) quantum number(s), as well as discussing how information on the classical period and revival time is encoded in the energy eigenvalue spectrum. We discuss a number of one-dimensional model systems which exhibit revival behavior, including the infinite well, the quantum bouncer, and others, as well as several two-dimensional integrable quantum billiard systems. Finally, we briefly review the experimental evidence for wave packet revivals in atomic, molecular, and other systems, and related revival phenomena in condensed matter and optical systems.},
